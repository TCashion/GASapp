# GASapp
## Store Your Gear

Music enthusiasts often suffer from something called GAS - “Gear Acquisition Syndrome.” This is a problem that manifests as buying more music gear than any one person can need in a lifetime, many times over!  

The traditional ways of logging and maintaining an inventory over all that gear (and knowing when your bassist swipes a few of your pedals) are many, and none are simple or intuitive.

GASapp is a place where you can store and evaluate all of your music gear in one, easy to access list. The app includes valuations on each piece of gear you own, or a price listing on your wish-list items (thanks to the Reverb.com API).
